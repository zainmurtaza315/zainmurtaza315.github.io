        <h1>Raptors entering Crucial stage of the Season </h1>

        
        <img class="raptors" src="https://communities-wcmimages-cache.prod.postmedia.digital/images?url=https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/TS20181017VH29204_67353502.jpg&w=840&h=560" alt="raptors">
 
            <p> The Raptors are entering a vital stage in Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry era. With the All Star break a little over two weeks away, questions still linger around one of the top teams in the NBA. How far can this group go? Do they have enough to get by the Boston Celtics or the Milwaukee Bucks? Is the roster, as presently constructed have enough shooting to keep up with the NBA’s best? We might not need to wait as long as the All Star break to figure this out, as the trade deadline (February 7th) approaches. What Masai Ujiri does there can answer a lot of these questions, and can also indicate to fans the intent the organization sends to its fanbase. </p>
    
            <h2> Lowry's Passive Nature Must Change for Aspiring Champions Raptors </h2>

                <p> 	Although he is coming off an injury that forced him to the sidelines for nearly a month, the Raptors might be a little concerned about Kyle Lowry. Lowry, who has been struggling to find his rhythm after the early season blitz from three, continues to be one of the Raptors largest “X factors” should they reach their potential to claw their way to the franchises first ever finals. Lowry’s three point stroke alluding him is not a large issue, it is his intent however, that remains uncertain. Lowry has admitted that this season has brought about new challenges for him, as he has never had as much scoring options as he does this year. Thus, leading to some nights of indecisiveness. However, the best Kyle Lowry is one that is aggressive on both ends. The Raptors will need the 32 year old point guard to flip the switch in the second half of the season. </p>

            <h3> Late Game Playbook; Kawhi or Kyle? </h3>

            <p>  The million dollar question amongst fans will always remain; who takes the final shot. The Raptors in the past have been predictable with their late game offense. However, this is one of the reasons why the Raptors have hired Nick Nurse; for his offensive creativity. Just simply look at the Warriors, the last shot would very rarely be decided by a do-or-die isolation play. What the Raptors can do is best emulate the world champions. Put the ball in the hands of your best player, trust him to take the shot, or swing it around the horn until the ball reaches the open man. It’s is simple, effective, and unpredictable.  </p>

             <h1> Finals Aspirations </h1>
               <p> The Raptors have one of the best records in the NBA. However, they didn’t just rack up wins against the bottom tier teams of the NBA, they have beaten some very good ones along the way. The Raptors remain one of the top 3 teams with the best record against teams .500 or better. This is a stat that should bode well for the Raptors. Victories against Boston, Golden State (twice), the Clippers, Indiana, and Philly should further headline how dominating the Raptors have been in the first half of the season. Considering the Raptors lead the league in different starting lineups, and player injuries, this makes the Raptors even more lethal once the lineup gets healthy.

                <h2> Conclusions! </h2> 
                <p> The Raptors are for real. Have you heard this before? So have we. But why believe it this time around? The Raptors have got more depth than ever before. The Raptors have one of the five best players in the NBA. The one thing the Raptors don’t have however, is LeBron James in the Eastern Conference. This should bode well for the Raptors as James is responsible for the franchises last three postseason exits. So sit back and have a laugh, this season is sure to have a thrilling finish! </p>
